opening should be shocking, I think destroying a abrahamic angle could be really wild.
- makes the opening protagonist morally questionable, along with other NPC's.
- this sparks a multi-pantheonic war.
- first hand witness to the event, a la Half Life.
- Thinking about switching up protagonists across chapters anyway, so next one could be lighter.


Next my thought was like SMT1-style apocalypse experiencer. 
- I think MT, SMT1 and Nocturned benift so much from this plot device.
- (personal preference?)
- I want it to be like a "dungeon" in some way, but it could be like a rendition of an outdoor area too.
- megacorp office in near future? It's like the most removed from cave cult start.
- crazy cyberpunk skybox.
- A future society with demons and humans already integrated, almost like Shadowrun.

I don't want to blow up the scope but this makes me think of how this character could be it's own kind of alignment rep. Like if you have several reincarnated deities with different outlooks (influenced by their canon morality and surrounding religion).

So "God" as in PKD Divine Invasion.
Krishna?
Lucifer.
Buddha.

But don't actually make them the real deities. Make them like representations that are your friends.
This is like really the work of a religious scholar.

Instead: Detailed Philosophical Archetypes:
"Belle": Buddha: Prince yogi archetype, middle way. Neutral.
"Lucky": Lucifer: Be True Detective's Matthew McCoughnehey. Chaos.
"Chris": Krishna: Perfect, loving, compassionate, kind, great lover. Neutral?
"Tera": Ameterasu: Aloof, intelligent, stand-off-ish, highly skilled, temper. Law.
